# One-Week Puerto Rico Itinerary

This no-FOMO plan hits El Yunque, east islands, coffee country, and the west coast—with realistic drive times and food stops that locals actually recommend.

## Day 1-2: Old San Juan & Metro Area

**Base:** Old San Juan or Condado
**Highlights:** Historic forts, local food scene, urban beaches

Start with Puerto Rico's cultural heart. Spend Day 1 exploring **Castillo San Felipe del Morro** and **San Cristóbal**, walking the cobblestone streets, and getting your bearings.

Day 2, venture to **Condado** and **Isla Verde** beaches for swimming and people-watching. Try **Kasalta** for breakfast (locals swear by their quesito pastries) and **La Placita** at night for rum and live music.

> **Pro tip:** Book fort tickets online in advance during peak season (December-April). The 10 AM time slots avoid both crowds and midday heat.

**Where to stay:** Hotel El Convento (historic), La Concha Resort (beachfront), or Airbnb in Condado

## Day 3: El Yunque Rainforest

**Drive time:** 1 hour east from San Juan
**Activities:** Waterfall hikes, swimming holes, tropical forest

The only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest system deserves a full day. **Reserve your entry passes** 5 days in advance—this is mandatory, not optional.

**Best trails for first-timers:**
- **Big Tree Trail** (0.5 miles, easy): Huge cecropia trees and river views
- **La Mina Trail** (0.7 miles, moderate): Ends at a 35-foot waterfall and swimming hole
- **Mount Britton Trail** (1.6 miles, challenging): Observation tower with forest canopy views

**Pack:** Water shoes for river crossings, rain jacket (it's a rainforest!), plenty of water, and snacks.

> **Weather reality check:** It rains almost daily in El Yunque, usually in afternoon thunderstorms. Start early and embrace the mist—it's part of the experience.

**Lunch:** Stop at **Luquillo Beach** afterward for **kioskos** (food stalls) and the island's best alcapurrias and bacalaitos.

## Day 4-5: Vieques or Culebra (Choose Your Island)

**Ferry from:** Fajardo (1 hour drive from San Juan)
**Stay overnight:** Island life moves slower—embrace it

### Option A: Vieques
**Best for:** Bioluminescent bay, wild horses, pristine beaches

Take the ferry to **Vieques** and rent a car or scooter immediately—the island is too big to walk but perfect for exploring. **Flamenco Beach** gets the headlines, but **Sun Bay** and **Red Beach** offer better swimming with fewer crowds.

The **bioluminescent bay** is the main evening attraction. Book a kayak tour with **Abe's Snorkeling** or **Island Adventures**—the organism glow strongest when you paddle through them.

### Option B: Culebra  
**Best for:** World-class beaches, snorkeling, smaller-island vibe

**Flamenco Beach** consistently ranks among the world's best beaches for good reason: white sand, crystal-clear water, and minimal development. The island is smaller than Vieques, making it easier to cover in two days.

**Tamarindo Beach** offers excellent snorkeling, while **Zoni Beach** provides a more secluded experience on the Atlantic side.

> **Ferry logistics:** Book return tickets when you arrive—they can sell out during peak season. Carry cash for everything; card acceptance is limited on both islands.

## Day 6: Coffee Country & Mountains

**Drive time:** 2 hours west to Adjuntas/Utuado region
**Highlights:** Coffee plantations, mountain scenery, local culture

Trade beaches for mountains with a drive through Puerto Rico's interior. The **Ruta del Café** takes you through working coffee farms, mountain towns, and the island's coolest weather.

**Must-stop:** **Hacienda San Pedro** for coffee tours and tastings. They explain the bean-to-cup process and let you pick coffee cherries during harvest season (October-February).

**Adventure add-on:** **Toro Verde** zip-lining offers the world's second-longest zip line if you want an adrenaline rush with your mountain views.

**Lunch:** **Sonia's Restaurant** in Adjuntas for authentic Puerto Rican mountain cuisine—their mofongo is legendary among locals.

**Base for the night:** Jayuya or Utuado (rural mountain towns) or drive toward Rincón for tomorrow's west coast exploration.

## Day 7: West Coast Sunset Tour

**Drive time:** 1 hour from coffee country to Rincón
**Highlights:** Surfing, sunset, coastal towns

End your week where Puerto Rico shows off its most reliable sunsets. **Rincón** is the island's surf capital, but even non-surfers love the laid-back vibe and beach bars.

**Beach progression:**
- **Morning:** **Steps Beach** for swimming and snorkeling
- **Afternoon:** **Sandy Beach** for surfing lessons or watching pros
- **Sunset:** **Domes Beach** for the island's most photographed sunsets

**Food stops:** **La Copa Llena** for fish tacos, **Café 413** for coffee and pastries, and **Tamboo Tavern** for sunset cocktails with your toes in the sand.

**Optional add-on:** If you have energy, drive 30 minutes south to **Cabo Rojo's Playa Sucia** for dramatic cliff scenery—but Rincón's sunsets are just as spectacular with better food and drinks.

## Pro Tips from Locals

1. **Eat where locals eat:** If the menu has English translations, it's probably tourist-priced
2. **Beach timing:** Mornings are cooler and less crowded; locals prefer late afternoon for swimming
3. **Traffic reality:** San Juan area has serious rush hour traffic (7-9 AM, 4-6 PM)—plan around it
4. **Pharmacy stops:** Walgreens and CVS are everywhere for forgotten essentials
5. **ATM strategy:** Bank machines are reliable in major towns but scarce in rural areas

This itinerary covers Puerto Rico's greatest hits without the exhausting pace of trying to see everything. Take time to slow down, talk to locals, and let the island's rhythm guide your week.
