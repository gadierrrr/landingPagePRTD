## Entry & Identification

**1. Do U.S. citizens need a passport to visit Puerto Rico?**
No. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory; U.S. citizens can fly with a TSA-accepted ID (REAL ID-compliant license, passport, etc.). Always verify your ID is acceptable before travel.

**2. What are the visa rules for non-U.S. citizens?**
The same as entering the United States. If you require a U.S. visa or are eligible for ESTA under the Visa Waiver Program, those rules apply. Check country-specific requirements in advance.

**3. Is there customs when flying to/from the mainland U.S.?**
No standard U.S. customs for domestic flights, but your bags pass a USDA agriculture inspection when departing Puerto Rico. Arrive a bit early to clear USDA before TSA.

**4. Can I bring fruits, plants, or pork products back?**
Many are restricted due to pest/disease controls. Declare all agriculture items at USDA; expect some items to be confiscated if not permitted.

**5. What ID do kids need to fly?**
Children under 18 usually don't need ID when traveling with an adult on domestic flights, but airlines may ask for proof of age for lap infants. Carry a birth certificate copy just in case.

**6. Are there COVID-19 entry rules in 2025?**
There are no special COVID entry rules for domestic travel as of late 2025. Health policies can change; check official guidance shortly before your trip.

**7. Do I need travel insurance?**
Optional but wise—especially during hurricane season. Look for policies covering medical care, trip interruption, and car rentals; verify storm-related exclusions.

**8. Can I drive with a U.S. license?**
Yes. Road rules mirror the mainland; observe seat belts and child-seat laws, and know that major highways use cashless tolls.

**9. What power outlets & voltage does Puerto Rico use?**
Standard U.S. 110V with Type A/B plugs. U.S. devices work without adapters.

**10. What about time zone and mail?**
Puerto Rico is on Atlantic Standard Time year-round (no Daylight Saving). USPS services and domestic shipping rates apply.

## Best Time, Weather & Events

**11. When is hurricane season?**
June 1–Nov 30, peaking Aug–Oct. Track forecasts, consider flexible bookings, and keep devices charged during storms.

**12. When's the best mix of weather and price?**
Shoulder months—late Apr–Jun and late Oct–Nov—balance fewer crowds, decent weather, and better rates versus peak winter.

**13. How hot does it get?**
Coasts sit in the mid-80s °F (≈29–31°C) most of the year with warm nights; mountains are cooler. Pack breathable layers and strong sun protection.

**14. Is sargassum seaweed an issue?**
It can be, especially spring–summer on eastern/southern shores. Conditions vary with winds/currents; check local beach updates close to your visit.

**15. When is surf season?**
North and west coasts see the most consistent swells in winter. Beginners should choose protected coves or book lessons.

**16. What big festivals should I know?**
San Sebastián Street Festival (SanSe) in mid-January, Carnaval Ponceño (usually Feb), and Noche de San Juan on June 23 are island standouts. Confirm exact dates annually.

**17. Are there notable food events?**
Culinary festivals (e.g., Saborea Puerto Rico) occur through the year with ticketed tastings and chef events. Book early—they sell out.

**18. Any recurring free concerts?**
Look for Ventana al Jazz and municipal cultural nights on select weekends. Schedules vary month to month.

**19. How many days do I need in San Juan?**
2–3 days cover the forts, old town, beaches, and some dining. Add a day trip (El Yunque or Fajardo) if time allows.

**20. Is El Yunque a day trip?**
Yes—plan half to full day for trails and waterfalls. Check official pages for any reservations, closures, or roadworks before you go.

---

## Safety, Health & Emergencies

**21. Is Puerto Rico safe for tourists?**
Generally yes—use normal city smarts: keep valuables out of sight, avoid isolated areas late, and lock vehicles. Stick to well-lit, busy streets at night.

**22. Any areas to avoid at night?**
As anywhere, avoid poorly lit or isolated blocks. If visiting neighborhoods outside main tourist zones, go with a local guide or during the day.

**23. What's the emergency number?**
Dial 911 for police, fire, and medical services. Save your hotel's number and any tour operator contacts.

**24. What health issues should I know in 2025?**
Dengue activity is elevated in 2025. Use EPA-registered repellent, wear long sleeves/pants at dusk/dawn, and seek care for high fever or severe symptoms.

**25. Is Zika a current concern?**
Local transmission has been minimal in recent years, but mosquito precautions remain sensible, especially for pregnant travelers—consult your clinician.

**26. Do I need special vaccines?**
No special shots for domestic travel; ensure routine vaccines are current. Seasonal flu/COVID boosters are a personal choice—ask your provider.

**27. Is tap water safe?**
Municipal systems generally meet U.S. standards. In rural areas after storms/outages, choose bottled/filtered water until service normalizes.

**28. How do I prepare for hurricanes/tropical storms?**
Monitor official forecasts, enable wireless emergency alerts, keep cash and water on hand, and follow local instructions. Consider trip insurance during season.

**29. Are beaches always safe to swim?**
No—rip currents and high surf can be dangerous, especially on the north/west coasts. Prefer lifeguarded balnearios, heed flags/signs, and ask locals.

**30. Any sunscreen or reef rules?**
Many operators and protected areas encourage mineral "reef-safe" sunscreen. Follow local guidance to protect corals and seagrass.

## Top Things to Do & Where to Go

**31. What are the must-see historical sites in San Juan?**
Castillo San Felipe del Morro, Castillo San Cristóbal, city walls, and Paseo del Morro. Wear a hat, bring water, and allow a half-day.

**32. What makes El Yunque special?**
It's the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest System—lush trails, waterfalls, and scenic drives. Check weather/road advisories before you go.

**33. Where are Puerto Rico's bioluminescent bays?**
Three: Mosquito Bay (Vieques), Laguna Grande (Fajardo), and La Parguera (Lajas). Choose a moonless night for the brightest glow.

**34. Can I swim in the biobays?**
Swimming is typically permitted only at La Parguera. In Vieques and Fajardo, tours protect the ecosystem by not allowing swimming—confirm rules when booking.

**35. Why is Mosquito Bay famous?**
It's often called the brightest biobay due to very high dinoflagellate concentration. Book early and avoid full-moon nights.

**36. What's special about Flamenco Beach (Culebra)?**
White sand, turquoise water, and excellent snorkeling in marked areas. Facilities are limited—pack water/shade and leave no trace.

**37. Are Cabo Rojo's cliffs worth it?**
Yes—dramatic views at Los Morrillos lighthouse, saline flats, and photo-worthy coastline. Stay well back from cliff edges, especially on windy days.

**38. Where can I zipline?**
Toro Verde (Orocovis) is famous for long lines and suspension bridges; other parks offer canopy tours closer to San Juan. Check height/weight limits.

**39. Best beaches near San Juan?**
Condado, Ocean Park, Escambrón, and Isla Verde/Carolina. For families, Balneario de Carolina often has facilities and calm areas when flags permit.

**40. Is Vieques worth an overnight?**
Yes—quiet beaches, wild horses, and better odds for a great Mosquito Bay tour. Reach the island by ferry (Ceiba) or small plane.

## Transportation & Ferries

**41. Best way to get from San Juan to Rincón?**
Drive (≈2.5–3.5 hours) via PR-22/PR-2 depending on traffic. There's no island-wide intercity rail/bus network.

**42. How do I visit Culebra for a day?**
Take the Ceiba→Culebra ferry and rent a jeep/golf cart on arrival to reach beaches. Weekends/holidays sell out—book in advance.

**43. How reliable are the ferries?**
Service runs multiple crossings daily; weather and high demand can affect schedules. Arrive early and secure round-trip tickets.

**44. Do I need a car on Vieques/Culebra?**
Usually yes. Distances and limited transit make car/golf cart rentals or taxis the best bet—reserve ahead.

**45. Is Uber available?**
Common around San Juan metro; coverage thins in rural towns and on the islands. Always check the app where you're staying.

**46. How do taxis work at SJU airport?**
Licensed taxis operate with posted zone rates. Confirm the fare (and card acceptance) with the dispatcher/driver before departing.

**47. How do highway tolls work?**
Major expressways are cashless. Rentals provide an AutoExpreso transponder and bill you after; ask your agency about admin fees.

**48. Is public transit useful for tourists?**
Tren Urbano and AMA buses serve the metro, but routes/hours aren't ideal for most visitors. Combine walking with Uber/taxis.

**49. Any scenic road trips?**
West coast beach-hop (Isabela→Aguadilla→Rincón), south to Cabo Rojo, or mountain routes like Ruta Panorámica (allow extra time for curves/stops).

**50. Can I bike or e-scooter around?**
Short urban segments (Condado/Ocean Park) work, but roads can be narrow and busy. Wear a helmet, use lights, and ride defensively.
