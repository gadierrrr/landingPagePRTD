# Best Beaches: Cabo Rojo to La Parguera

The southwest coast offers Puerto Rico's most diverse beach experiences: dramatic cliffs, protected bays, world-class snorkeling, and the island's most reliable sunsets.

## Essential Beach Stops

### Playa Sucia (Cabo Rojo)

**Best for:** Dramatic scenery, photography, cliff views
**Drive time:** 2.5 hours from San Juan

The poster child of Puerto Rico beaches, where white sand meets turquoise water beneath towering limestone cliffs. The **Los Morrillos Lighthouse** provides the iconic Instagram shot, especially at golden hour.

**Getting there:** Park at the lighthouse and walk 10 minutes down the sandy trail. Bring water—there are no facilities.

> **Local tip:** Visit early morning or late afternoon. Midday sun reflecting off the white sand and cliffs can be intense.

### Playa Boquerón

**Best for:** Swimming, families, amenities
**Drive time:** 2.5 hours from San Juan

Puerto Rico's most developed beach town with a mile-long crescent of golden sand, calm waters, and full amenities. The **malecón** (boardwalk) comes alive at sunset with food trucks and live music.

**Where to eat:** **Galloway's** for fish tacos and cold beer, or try the **alcapurrias** from beachfront vendors.

### Playuela (Gilligan's Island)

**Best for:** Snorkeling, day trips, crystal-clear water
**Access:** 15-minute boat ride from Guánica

A small cay with some of Puerto Rico's clearest water and healthiest coral reefs. The protected lagoon is perfect for beginner snorkeling, while the outer reef offers more challenging diving.

**Getting there:** Book through **Copamarina Beach Resort** or local operators in Guánica. Tours include snorkel gear and often lunch on the beach.

## La Parguera: Bioluminescent Magic

### The Bioluminescent Bay

**Best for:** Night tours, unique experiences
**When to visit:** New moon nights for maximum brightness

One of only three bioluminescent bays in the world, where microscopic organisms create blue-green light when disturbed. The effect is strongest on moonless nights.

**Tour options:**
- **Kayak tours** offer the most intimate experience (you create the light as you paddle)
- **Boat tours** cover more area and include educational content
- **Swimming tours** let you literally light up the water around you

> **Important:** Book tours that emphasize environmental protection. The bay's brightness has dimmed over decades due to pollution and boat traffic.

### Mangrove Channels

**Best for:** Kayaking, wildlife spotting, peaceful exploration
**Best time:** Early morning for birds, late afternoon for golden light

The maze of mangrove channels around La Parguera offers protected paddling with incredible biodiversity. Spot **manatees**, **pelicans**, and **juvenile fish** in the nursery waters.

**Guided vs. self-guided:** First-timers should book guided tours to navigate safely and learn about the ecosystem. Experienced paddlers can rent kayaks in town.
