# Old San Juan in 48 Hours

Make the most of a weekend in Puerto Rico's historic heart with this walkable itinerary that hits the essential sights, local coffee spots, and sunset views.

## Day 1: Forts and Foundations

**Morning (9 AM - 12 PM)**
Start at **Castillo San Felipe del Morro** before the heat sets in. Book your timed entry in advance and explore the tunnels, ramparts, and commanding views of the Atlantic. The fort's history spans 500 years of Spanish colonial defense.

> **Insider tip:** Enter through the main gate for the full ceremonial approach, but if you're short on time, the side entrance near the lighthouse gets you to the best views faster.

**Lunch (12 PM - 1 PM)**
Walk to **Cuatro Sombras** for locally roasted coffee and a light lunch. Their cortado and avocado toast fuel the afternoon perfectly. The roastery overlooks the bay with outdoor seating.

**Afternoon (1 PM - 5 PM)**
Explore the cobblestone streets between **Fortaleza** and **San José Church**. Duck into **Casa Blanca** for a quieter historical experience and gardens with city views. 

Browse local artisan shops along **Calle del Cristo**—look for handmade jewelry at Boveda and locally-made soaps at Spice Islands.

**Evening (5 PM - sunset)**
End at **Paseo del Morro** for golden hour photos and sunset over the Atlantic. The grassy field fills with families flying kites as the light fades.

## Day 2: Culture and Coast

**Morning (8 AM - 11 AM)**
Beat the crowds at **Castillo San Cristóbal**, the larger fortress that protected against land attacks. The underground tunnels and multiple levels offer cooler exploration on hot days.

**Late Morning (11 AM - 1 PM)**
Walk the **city walls** from San Cristóbal toward the Governor's mansion. Stop at **La Fortaleza** for exterior photos (tours require advance booking).

Browse the **Paseo de la Princesa** promenade and its weekend artisan market (Saturdays and Sundays).

**Lunch (1 PM - 2 PM)**
Try **Café Mallorca** for traditional mallorca sweet bread and café con leche—a local breakfast that works perfectly for lunch.

**Afternoon (2 PM - 6 PM)**
Cool off at **Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico** or explore the **Instituto de Cultura** galleries. If it's too hot for more walking, this is your air-conditioned cultural time.

Alternatively, take a short Uber to **Condado Beach** for swimming and people-watching (15-minute ride from Old San Juan).

**Evening (6 PM - late)**
Return for dinner at **Marmalade** (upscale) or **El Jibarito** (local favorite). Both require reservations on weekends.

End with drinks at **La Placita** in nearby Santurce or rooftop bars back in Old San Juan like **Nuyorican Café** for live music.
